Merge Conflict Indicators Explanation

The editor has the following merge conflict indicators:
1)<<<<<<< HEAD everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what's on the current branch
2)||||||| merged common ancestors everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what the original lines were
3)======= is the end of the original lines, everything that follows (until the next indicator) is what's on the branch that's being merged in
4)>>>>>>> heading-update is the ending indicator of what's on the branch that's being merged in (in this case, the heading-update branch)

1)choose which line(s) to keep
2)remove all lines with indicators
