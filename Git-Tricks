you can create your own git commands by using :


* alias name(whatever you want) = (git command you want to make)

*Example : git graph = git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph 
graph 
now you can just call graph for running all these commands 


* git diff master ..(name of branch) :

it shows us, what will change when we want to merge that branch to the master.

* git branch --merged : 

it shows us which branch has merged
